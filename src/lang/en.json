  "Info": "Thank You for helping others! <br/><br/>The most needed items are toilet paper, soap, toothbrush, toothpaste, laundry detergent, dish-soap, any cleaning supplies or toiletries are great. For more specific needs, please contact the organization directly. <br/><br/>You can donate new things and used things. Not sure if you should donate an item? Just contact the organization and ask them if they need it. General rule - would you feel comfortable giving it to a friend or a family member? <br/><br/>The best thing you can donate is your time, a lot of organizations need help with something.<br/><br/>If you want to help orphans: please consider spending time with the kids. They want to play with other people, they want to learn from others, they need a normal social life. <br/><br/>If you would like to help improve the project - <a href=\"mailto:apply@kaizerwald.com\">apply@kaizerwald.com</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/gianpaj/helpmap.io\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/gianpaj/helpmap.io</a><br/><br/>Have a great day, you are awesome!"
